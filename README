illumos-hal README - Sep 24, 2014.

This tree is an extraction of some of the HAL code from illumos-gate.

These are utilities that are needed for integrating illumos with desktop
software. Specifically, this software is necessary for integration with
the X server, and also with various freedesktop.org components.  It's likely
that these bits are of little use for a server installation.  You will want
these bits if you want to make use of automatic removable media handling, or
want the support for rmformat, eject, etc.  Again, these are rarely useful for
server installations.

The idea is that this represents a new "consolidation" separate from illumos
proper, so that distributions that have no need for these bits can dispense
with them.  This is especially useful as these bits have dependencies which
bring in various GPL and LGPL licensed components.

This builds like illumos-gate, and has packages.  However, it needs the
following to be installed on the build system:

	* pkg:/system/header/header-audio
	* pkg:/developer/build/onbld
	* pkg:/library/glib2
	* pkg:/library/libxml2
	* pkg:/library/libxslt
	* pkg:/system/library/dbus
	* pkg:/system/library/libdbus
	* pkg:/system/library/libdbus-glib

Also, you'll need the appropriate C compiler.  It should use the
same as illumos-gate to build.
